# Information on the blog app

Contains the views file where we create different views for various functions of the app.
Then a view is created in the views file and an associated url in the app urls file

To view the shell we just use python manage.py shell
I am using an sqlite db for development
In class meta in the forms file, we create a model that interacts with the user and then we specify the fields which as of this case is from the registration form
Class Meta provides a nested namespace for configurartions and keeps them in place
